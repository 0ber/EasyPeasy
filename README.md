**EasyPeasy** is the framework you need to create *Autolayout* constraints programmatically without headaches and never ending boilerplate code. Besides the basics, **EasyPeasy** resolves most of the constraint conflicts for you and lets you attach to a constraint conditional closures that are evaluated before applying a constraint, this lets you apply (or not) a constraint depending on platform, size classes, orientation... or the state of your controller, easy peasy!

In this quick tour through **EasyPeasy** we assume that you already know the advantages and disadvantages of the different *Autolayout* APIs and therefore you won't see a comparison of the code side by side, just read and decide whether **EasyPeasy** is for you or not.
